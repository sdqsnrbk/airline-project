    "# Final Project: Airline Reservation System Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "This final project builds upon your midterm project (the airline reservation system) and introduces **authentication**, **custom middleware**, and **REST API functionality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will extend your project by adding:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Authentication for different user roles.\n",
    "* New request-response logic to handle authentication and authorization.\n",
    "* Programmatic access to flight and booking data through an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is not a group project.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Base Project:** Use your midterm project as a foundation. If you haven't submitted or completed your midterm project, you will need to build that functionality from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Extend with Authentication:** Implement authentication to support three types of users (note that only two are added to the database, as guest doesnâ€™t require a database entry):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Regular users:**\n",
    "        * Can register, login, and logout.\n",
    "        * Can book flights and receive a booking code.\n",
    "        * Can edit their account information.\n",
    "        * Can only view their own booking codes.\n",
    "        * Can view flight and airport information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Admin users:**\n",
    "        * Cannot register through the standard registration process. You will need to create an admin user manually using the `manage.py` utility file.\n",
    "        * Provide the admin user's credentials in a separate `txt`, `doc`, or `pdf` file.\n",
    "        * Can view all registered users and their information (including all booking codes).\n",
    "        * Can create new users, as well as edit and/or delete existing users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Guest users:**\n",
    "        * Do not have a permanent account.\n",
    "        * Can register for a regular user account.\n",
    "        * Can view flight and airport information but cannot book flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Implement Custom Middleware:** Add **one** custom middleware component that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Detects if a user is visiting the website for the first time (before registration).\n",
    "    * Greets first-time users and provides them with a random promo code in a popup window or banner.\n",
    "    * Does not display the promo code to returning users.\n",
    "    * You can simulate new user sessions using your browser's incognito mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Develop RESTful API Endpoints:** Implement the following four RESTful API endpoints to allow fetching flight information without rendering HTML. The specific URLs can vary based on your project's structure, but the functionality must be the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `GET /api/flights/`: Returns a JSON list of all flights.\n",
    "    * `GET /api/flights/<id>/`: Returns detailed flight information (origin, destination, capacity) for a specific flight ID.\n",
    "    * `POST /api/bookings/`: Allows creating a new booking using JSON data in the request body.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Example JSON Request Body:**\n",
    "        ```json\n",
    "        {\n",
    "          \"flight_id\": 3,\n",
    "          \"name\": \"Ali Baigelenov\",\n",
    "          \"email\": \"ali@gmail.com\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `GET /api/bookings/<booking_code>/`: Returns booking details based on the provided booking code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Apply Basic Styling:** Ensure that any new pages you create for this project have a similar basic styling as the example presented in your midterm project.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Submit Code Reflection Document:** You **must** submit a `txt`, `doc`, or `pdf` file containing a code reflection. **This document will constitute a significant portion of your grade.** Failure to submit this document will result in an automatic **0** for the entire final project, with no exceptions or redo opportunities. Your code reflection should answer the following four questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * What does your custom middleware do, and how does it work?\n",
    "    * What problems did you face with authentication or the API? How did you fix them?\n",
    "    * Pick one of the functions in your `views.py` file that you wrote and explain it line-by-line what it does.\n",
    "    * If you had more time, what would you improve or what additional functionality would you add?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files to Submit:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **zip file** containing all the files in your project directory.\n",
    "* A `txt`, `doc`, or `pdf` file with the **credentials for the regular users and the admin user** that you created.\n",
    "* A `txt`, `doc`, or `pdf` file containing your **code reflection** answering the four specified questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **20%** - Midterm project's functionality is working properly with all its original features.\n",
    "* **15%** - User authentication works correctly (registration, login, logout, different user roles, proper access control).\n",
    "* **10%** - Custom middleware functions as described.\n",
    "* **20%** - REST API endpoints are implemented correctly and function as specified.\n",
    "* **10%** - Basic styling is applied to new pages.\n",
    "* **25%** - Code reflection document is included and thoroughly answers all four questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORT NOTE: IF A STUDENT DOES NOT SUBMIT A CODE REFLECTION DOCUMENT, THEY WILL RECEIVE A GRADE OF 0 FOR THE ENTIRE FINAL PROJECT (No do-overs).**\n"
